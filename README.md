  <h1>A cat-inspired texting app created using PHP, AngularJS, Twitter bootstrap.</h1>
  <p>I created it so that my family can text each other easily while in diferent rooms in their house. Anyways i thought to make it open-source. It's a scratch on the surface of what you can do with PHP and AngularJS.</p>
